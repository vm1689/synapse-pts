# Synapse PTS Tracker Content

<!-- Last Refreshed: 2026-01-16T09:00:00Z -->

## Plan

### Objective
Probability of trial success (PTS) is estimated using a multi-factor model that incorporates clinical, regulatory, and competitive variables. Each trial is scored on a 0-100% scale reflecting likelihood of achieving primary endpoints and regulatory approval.

### Clinical Factors
- **Phase & Design**: Historical phase transition rates by therapeutic area. Randomized controlled trials weighted higher than single-arm studies.
- **Efficacy Signal**: Prior phase data benchmarked against approved therapies and competitor readouts. Effect size relative to placebo and clinical meaningfulness.
- **Safety Profile**: Adverse event rates, discontinuations, and regulatory holds. Class-specific risks and tolerability considerations.

### Strategic Factors
- **Regulatory Path**: FDA designations (Breakthrough, Fast Track, RMAT) improve probability. Prior agency interactions and guidance incorporated.
- **Competitive Dynamics**: Market entrants, competitor failures, and differentiation potential. First-in-class vs. best-in-class positioning.
- **Execution Risk**: Enrollment pace and partnership status. Trials behind enrollment targets flagged for execution risk.

### Output & Actions
- **PTS ≥60%**: High conviction. Continue execution per protocol. Prepare for next value inflection.
- **PTS 40-59%**: Moderate conviction. Monitor for data updates, competitive events, or enrollment changes.
- **PTS <40%**: Below investment threshold. Schedule team review to evaluate go/no-go decision and capital reallocation.

## Executive Summary

Portfolio Action Required

Recommend steering committee review for {reviewCount} programs below the 40% PTS threshold to evaluate capital reallocation. Priority focus: {lowestTrial.trial_name} ({lowestTrial.pts_score}% PTS) in {lowestTrial.indication} faces execution and competitive headwinds requiring go/no-go decision. Upside catalyst: {topTrial.trial_name} ({topTrial.pts_score}% PTS) represents highest-conviction opportunity with 2026 readout in {topTrial.indication}.
